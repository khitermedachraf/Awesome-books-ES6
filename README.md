# Project Name : Awesome books

>"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books, It allows user to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that your website will be more interactive. You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. It uses simple GUI (medium-fidelity wireframe) and relies on DOM manipulation in pure JS and using local storage.

## Project requirements

- Setup your project:
  - Create a new directory and initialize it with git.
  - Use `npm init -y` command to create package.json file.
  - Linters configuration.
  - Create the entry point for your JavaScript code called `index.js`
  - Create `index.css` file for your styles.
  - Create the main `index.html` file. Link your `index.js` and `index.css` files there.
  - Create a directory called `modules`.
- Re-create your _Awesome books_ app following the rules:
  - Use ES6 syntax.
  - Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the `modules` dir. Import modules in the `index.js` file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
  - Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
  - Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
  - Use let and const in a correct way.

- Display the current date below the navigation bar. 
  - For this requirement you should use a library [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6)
  - Download the script and save it to your project. 
  - Import it as a module.
  - See the article [Get the current date and time](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/tour?id=get-the-current-date-and-time). Your task here is to use a new tool effectively with little externally curated support. Exactly as you will do in your future job.
